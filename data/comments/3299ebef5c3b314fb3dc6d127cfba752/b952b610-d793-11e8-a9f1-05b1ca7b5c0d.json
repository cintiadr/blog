I guess you are talking about Bamboo Specs, in particular the Java flavour? \r\n\r\nhttps://confluence.atlassian.com/bamboo/bamboo-specs-894743906.html\r\n\r\n> for some reason\r\n\r\nYes. There is no SOME reason, but MULTIPLE reasons why a robust configuration-as -code requires a high-level programming language. Configuration IS a code. No matter if written in SHELL, JSON, YAML, Groovy, Java or anything else. And if this is a code, we shall maintain it as code. Think about things like:\r\n\r\n * code highlighting, syntax checks, and code autocompletion\r\n * validation when you compile and run offline tests\r\n * use high-level language features like modularization or libraries\r\n\r\nSee more reasons here: https://confluence.atlassian.com/bamboo/bamboo-java-specs-941616821.html\r\n\r\n\r\nI highly recommend first: to get familiar with it, second: to try it out in practice. You will very quickly see superiority of high-level language compared to e.g. YAML if your build configuration has 10 or more jobs. \r\n\r\nI recommend to start with:\r\n\r\n* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mU4-7foED3I \r\n* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oVqU7lLnqQ\r\n\r\nand tutorials:\r\n* https://confluence.atlassian.com/bamboo/tutorial-create-a-simple-plan-with-bamboo-java-specs-894743911.html\r\n* https://confluence.atlassian.com/bamboo/tutorial-bamboo-java-specs-stored-in-bitbucket-server-938641946.html\r\n\r\n\r\nPS: Java is just a language. You can write Bamboo Specs in Groovy, Kotlin, Scala or any other  programming language for JVM. It's up to you. And if you really really want to stick with YAML (why?), there is a (simplified) version of Bamboo Specs for YAML.","date":"2018-10-24T13:50:10.778Z"}
