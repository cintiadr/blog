Turns out that the vacuum analyze did not really load all the data into the EBS volume, and because the 11.x query planner was making use of an index scan instead of a table scan, I was again stuck with a piece of data that was not yet loaded in the volume. \r\n\r\nThe solution:vacuum(analyze, DISABLE_PAGE_SKIPPING), to ensure that the  vacuum process does not skip any pages (which actually happened in my case)","date":"2019-11-14T16:01:14.511Z"}
