[LCA](https://linux.conf.au/) has a special place in my heart.

It has been happening now for 20 years (!).
This year it was in Christchurch, New Zealand. Nope, nothing weird about it, keep it cool.

Linux Conf runs for five days. The first two days are mini-conferences, the last three the main conference.
Contrary to what you'd expect, it's a conference about _all the things open_. Open source communities, open hardware, open source products, team, processes, documentation, security. A little bit of everything.

Between talks we have the amazing [BoFs (Birds of a Feather)](https://2019.linux.conf.au/wiki/BoF) sessions spontaneously happening for all sort of topics. This year I managed to learn how to knit!

Also tried a slackline and went to karaoke. Friendly people, nice talks, nice friends. The conference happens half IRL and half via email/twitter.


And [next day video](http://www.nextdayvideo.com/) somehow always manage to provide livestream and release all videos in a couple of hours, which is nothing sort of a miracle imo.

So here's my curated list of talks, for those interested.
